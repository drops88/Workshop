# How to service Manitou Fork

## Introduction

This process was designed specifically for Manitou forks that utilize TPC and Absolute damping but many of these tips will be applicable no matter which fork you ride (just remember to check the owner's guide that came with your fork for specifics).

Continuing to run a fork past its service interval will cause excessive wear which can cost more to repair. Let's face it: in today's economy, no one can afford to spend needlessly. As a licensed technician in Canada, I always tell my students and former customers: You can pay a little now… or a lot later. Servicing your MTB fork yourself will save you a bunch of cash in the long run. This is actually a pretty simple job and believe it or not there is only one special tool that you may need depending on your fork.

**WARNING:** Before attempting any work or opening the fork, make sure you release any pretension or air pressure.

**CAUTION:** When re-assembling your fork, follow all manufacturer-recommended torque procedures. If you don't own a torque wrench, now may be the time to invest.

**DO it right…FIX it right….DO not over tight!**

Who should attempt this task? If you're not afraid to change your tires or make minor repairs, this job really isn't that much harder. All you have to remember is to take pictures of the deconstruction and follow your service guide. Changing the fork seals and fluid is actually easier than it sounds – just make sure you have a clean place to work and a solid work bench. Please remember to go over the list of necessary equipment before you start the job.
